# java9-repl
Discovering the REPL features for the Java Guild

## What does this new feature do?
Introduces a _Read Eval Print Loop_ with the `jshell` command, runnable from your favorite shell.

A _REPL_ is usually considered to be on the same _level_ as _TDD_: as a learning and experimentation instrument.



## What are the advantages and disadvantages?
### Advantages
* It provides a helpful `/help` command, allowing one to learn _on demand_ about all of the features `jshell` offers.
* Instead of debugging, get quick feedback on small pieces of code.
* No need to deal with _Checked Exceptions_.
* IntelliJ has support for an embedded REPL.
* Excellent tool for beginners to start learning immediately without having to install IDE's, dependency management tools, etc.

### Disadvantages
* Java, the language, doesn't exactly lend itself for small snippets, because of its verbosity.
* Usually experiments for small bits of code are done in Unit Tests, providing a consistent, rerunnable history of _experiments_ that document how our code works.
